# Python-QR-Code
Using the qrcode library, this project is able to encode and decode QR codes.

Somethings I learned from this: 
  - how to make QR codes
  - how to use Py QRcode library
  - how to do pip installs and updating pip

* used Tomi tutorial

I went back and learned about the different parameters that can be controlled when making a QR code such as the size or number of the blocks. This is seen in deska qr2.py and shopdeska_qr2.png
